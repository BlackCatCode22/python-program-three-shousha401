# My Program
*  allows you to add contacts
* view a list of contacts
* search for contacts by name
* save contacts to a file
* and exit the program
## The approach focuses on creating a user-friendly and interactive contact management system using functions,
data structures, input validation,
and the ability to save contacts to a file for future use.
It also incorporates a menu-driven interface to make it easy for users to interact with the program.
